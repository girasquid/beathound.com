        <h2>All things must end</h2>
        <p>What a ride it's been.</p>
        <p><strong>I launched Beathound on September 24, 2012</strong>, and then ran it for just about 7 years. As I write this, it's July 17 2019.</p>
        <p><strong>Just about 9,000 people uploaded their libraries</strong> to Beathound &mdash; if you were one of those people, thank you so much for trying out this tiny little thing I built.</p>
        <p>Beathound sent over a million emails over its lifetime (just think of the digital trees ðŸŒ²), tracking new releases for over 180,000 artists on iTunes. It spawned a small constellation of music services, for a while &mdash; the best music recommendation engine on the web, a magic recommendations playlist a few years before <a href="https://www.spotify.com/discoverweekly/">Spotify's Discover Weekly</a>, a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beathound/nmbfhhkeipafjhcfdaiedikbnkkcbneb?hl=en">Chrome extension</a>, and a couple other projects that never quite saw the light of day.</p>
        <p><strong>I learned so much working on Beathound and sharing it with you all</strong>, from figuring out how to survive getting Lifehackered on launch day to learning how to grow and scale a tiny side project that people loved.</p>
        <p><strong>Beathound was a product of its time</strong> &mdash; built when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grooveshark">Grooveshark</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio">Rdio</a> were still major players in the music streaming industry, Spotify hadn't won yet, and Apple Music was just a glimmer in someone's eye.</p>
        <p>The world has changed a lot since then, and Beathound didn't change with it &mdash; eventually becoming too much of a burden for me to be able to continue supporting it.</p>
        <p><strong>Beathound is down for good.</strong> Thank you to everyone who was a part of the journey.</p>
